# Communicate Data Findings: Ford GoBike
## by Che-Hsien Lin


## Dataset

I choose Ford GoBike bike ride data from 2018/01 to 2019/02 for my project. The data was downloaded from here https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data. The data is about bike ride date, station information, member type, gender and age.


## Summary of Findings
During 2018/01 to 2019/02, the main group of Ford bike ride users are from 20 to 40. 75% users are male and 25% users are female. 89% users are subscribers and 11% users are customers. Most of the bike rides took place during the weekday commuting hours, 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. Subscribers tend to ride more often but the duration of each ride is shorter. The overall bike ride trend is upward and high seasons were from 2018/04 to 2018/10.  


## Key Insights for Presentation

Male users in the age of 20 to 40 are the main users of Ford Gobike service. Among all users, 89% of them chose to become a subscriber by paying $15 per month. It is very likely that they use Ford Gobike for commuting purpose.
